#**Part 1**
Using variables with addition
```{r}
a <- 3
b <- 2

print(a + b)
```
#**Part 2**
Using the sum function
```{r}
sum(2,3)
```
#**Part 3**
Scatterplot of arrival delay versus departure delay
```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
####
#Script for HW4, generating plot of American Airlines arrival/departure delays
####

library(tidyverse)
library(nycflights13)

AA_flights <- filter(flights, carrier == "AA")

ggplot(data = AA_flights) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = dep_delay, y = arr_delay, color = as.factor(month)))


```

The data shows that most arrival and departure delays are between 0 and 500 minutes in length and that these delays are concentrated from July to September
