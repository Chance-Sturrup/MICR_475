Different manufacturers produce different classes of vehicles. I want to investigate which classes of vehicle are most widespread throughout different manufacturers, and whether this trend has changed over time.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)


ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = class, y = manufacturer, color = year))


```

The plot suggests that the two most universally produced classes of vehicles are SUVs and midsize ones. The creation of midsize vehicles is also a more recent addition to the automobile industry.
